# 🗺️ Black Tech Career Map (2025–2027)

A data-driven, survival-focused city ranking strategy built for Black tech professionals navigating the U.S. job market during a politically uncertain era.

## ✊ Who This Is For

This repository is for mid-career to senior-level Black professionals in tech, particularly those transitioning into:
- AI-focused Business Analyst roles
- DevOps & Solutions Architect positions
- R & RShiny-based data visualization roles

Created by a 53-year-old Black American technologist with over a decade in IT and a vision to relocate to Sweden, this case study is designed for anyone balancing:

- Job market re-entry after layoffs
- Concern over Christian Nationalism’s influence in U.S. politics
- A desire for safe, supportive cities with strong tech networks
- The need for Medicaid, SNAP, or other benefits during transition
- A long-term plan to work internationally or remote-first
