* AI-focused Business Analyst roles

* Job market re-entry after layoffs
* Concern over Christian Nationalism‚Äôs influence in U.S. politics
* A desire for safe, supportive cities with strong tech networks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Avoid

Based on 2025 data from PRRI, the U.S. Census, BLS, and digital equity indexes, the following areas raise multiple red flags for Black tech professionals, especially those seeking safety, strong social services, and inclusive professional networks:

* **Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia, Arkansas (Little Rock), and Oklahoma (Tulsa, Oklahoma City)**
  ‚ûî These regions have among the **highest concentrations of Christian Nationalist sentiment** (PRRI, 2023‚Äì2025) with over **35‚Äì45% of residents expressing support for making Christianity the basis of U.S. law**.

  ‚ûî **SNAP and Medicaid support** ranks below national averages due to limited state expansions and low per-capita investment in safety nets.

  ‚ûî **Digital infrastructure and broadband access** are significantly less developed compared to metro areas like Denver or D.C., limiting remote work reliability.

  ‚ûî **Tech workforce diversity** is among the lowest in the U.S., with Black representation in professional and STEM roles often below 5% in Oklahoma and Arkansas.

  ‚ûî DEI-related layoffs and anti-CRT political movements have created a climate of suppression or marginalization for professionals of color in state-funded institutions and public universities.

While every city and region has nuance, these trends indicate increased risk for isolation, limited opportunity, and policy hostility toward inclusive innovation ecosystems.
